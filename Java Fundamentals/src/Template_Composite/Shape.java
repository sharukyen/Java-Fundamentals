/**
 *The composite pattern describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
 *
 * For example: Users should be able to add one or more simple shape(s), or one or more container(s) into a list of instructions. Each container contains zero or more shape(s) (i.e. single or composite). You should do the following:
 *
 * Task 1: Implement the abstract Shape class.
 * Task 2: Implement the leaf object (i.e. Circle class) which is a single object and does not have children.
 * Task 3: Implement the composite object (i.e. Container class) which is the composite object and contains children.
 * Define an abstract class named Shape which represents a rectangular shape. The Shape class contains the following:
 *
 * A protected Rectangle data field named rect which defines a rectangle boundary of a shape.
 * A protected String data field named color which defines the colour of a shape.
 * A constructor which takes 4 integers (x, y, width and height) and a string as parameters and creates an object.
 * A method named toString() which returns a string representation of the object as in the examples below. You may find the getClass().getSimpleName() method useful.
 * An abstract method named draw(String indent) which takes an indent as a parameter and prints the shape.
 * Continuing on from the previous question, define a subclass named Circle which extends the Shape abstract class. The Circle class contains the following:
 *
 * A constructor which takes 4 integers (x, y, width and height) and a string as parameters and creates a Circle object.
 * A method named draw(String indent) which takes an indent as a parameter and prints the circle with the given indent.
 *
 * Continuing on from the previous question, define a subclass named Container which extends the Shape abstract class. TheContainer class contains the following:
 *
 * A private ArrayList<Shape> named elements which defines a list of shapes (i.e. circles or containers) in a container.
 * A constructor which takes 4 integers (x, y, width and height) and a string as parameters and creates a Container object.
 * A method named add(Shape s) which takes a shape as a parameter and adds the shape to the end of the list. Also, the method should change the color of the children to its containerâ€™s color once it is placed within a container.
 * A method named remove(Shape s) which removes the first occurrence of the specified shape from the children list. The method should change the colour of the removed shape to "black".
 * A method named draw(String indent) which takes an indent as a parameter and the shape itself and its children with the given indent. Note: all subsequent lines are indented by one single space.
